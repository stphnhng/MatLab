% make sure you are familiar with using matlab. 
% Do some of the homework assignments
% take a look at the preamble on canvas (equations)
    % be comfortable with using everything on that list.
% problems on exam draw more from 2nd half of the quarter.
    % Cumulative exam tho, so some of it is from 1st half.
% Chaos , fourier, SVD, transform : not expected to know a lot of this
    % most of it is to come from practical view.

% Hallmarks of chaos system.
    % Small changes in initial condition lead to big changes
    % as time goes on.
% Ex.: of Chaos Systems:
    % Double Pendulum, Weather, Planetary Motion (n body problem).
        % >2 bodies interacting graviationaly = chaotic system.
% Solving Chaotic Systems (Understand how solutions behave):
    % Entire field of dynamic systems.
    % try to say as much about a chaotic system as possible.
    % Ex.: Rossler Attractor -> Identified the general shape of 
    % movement.
        % "stable orbits"
    % Look for points of stability / fixed orbits.
        % If they were there, derivative of all 3 directions 
        % would be 0. (ending up at that point means you would
        % never leave it).
        % What happens around fixed orbits (points of stability)
            % fall into it
            % orbit around it
            % go away.
            
% Good to know double pendulum & 3 body problem.
    % examples of chaotic system and what it means 
    % in terms of context.
    % not expected to solve/set up problems.
    % be familiar with them as an example of chaotic systems.
    
    
% Vectorization   
    % HW.8 -> Chaotic ODE
% HW 8: chaotic ode
    % dx/dt = -a*x + f*y*z
    % dy_dt = c*y - d*x*z
    % dz/dt = -b*z + e*y^2
    % a = 16
    % b = 5
    % c = 10
    % d = 6
    % e = 18
    % f = 0.05
    
    
% each edge is 0.4 long with spacing 0.05
% center of cube = (0.3,2,12).

% continued on hw8_problem.
